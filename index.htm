<h2>Disability is Part of the Welcomed Diversity of Life </h2>
	<h3>Diversity is integral to our  society &amp; Front Range Community College All people are Welcome</h3>
<p>We use the word &ldquo;accommodation.&rdquo;  Accommodations describes academic adjustments to provide equal access to the  learning environment. Accommodations reduce barriers related to disabilitIies.  <br>
  Persons with  disabilities are welcomed as equal members into the diverse and inclusive  environment of the college. Accommodations are arranged and supported through  your Disability Support  Services (DSS) office. </p>
